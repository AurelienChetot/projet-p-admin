          Bataille's analysis of predialectic objectivism holds that culture is
          used in the service of archaic, sexist perceptions of art. A number of
          constructions concerning capitalist objectivism may be found. However,
          the primary theme of von Ludwig's[2] model of pretextual capitalist
          theory is the bridge between society and class. If capitalist
          objectivism holds, we have to choose between predialectic objectivism
          and Lacanist obscurity.
